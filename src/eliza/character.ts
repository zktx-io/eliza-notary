### ⚙️ AI Model
- ${modelProvider}

### 📝 Summary
The provided Move contract has been reviewed for security vulnerabilities and best practices.

### 🔍 Findings
1. **⚠️ Access Control Weakness**  
   - The contract lacks strict signer validation, allowing unauthorized state modifications.
2. **⚠️ State Mutation Risk**  
   - A \`mut borrow\` is used without proper validation, potentially leading to unintended state changes.

### ✅ Recommendations
- Implement role-based access control using \`capability\` objects.
- Use \`assert!()\` checks before modifying critical contract states.

### 🔴 **Security Rating: High**

### ⚙️ AI Model
- ${modelProvider}

### 📝 Summary
The function has been evaluated for security risks and best practices.

### 🔍 Findings
1. **⚠️ Lack of Error Handling**  
   - The function does not handle edge cases for invalid input values.
2. **⚠️ Unsafe Object Transfers**  
   - Direct object transfers without ownership verification may introduce unintended behavior.

### ✅ Recommendations
- Add explicit error handling for invalid function parameters.
- Validate \`signer\` and object ownership before performing transfers.
